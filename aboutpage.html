     Hey there, I'm Vansh Taneja, a 20-year-old with a passion for technology and a love for soccer. 
      Currently navigating the exciting world of Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at
      the University of Alberta, I call the vibrant city of Amritsar, Punjab, my hometown
      <br /><br />
      As I dive into the complexities of algorithms and coding languages, I find
      joy in the beautiful game of soccer, where every match is a new adventure.
      On the field or behind the screen, the thrill of competition and
      problem-solving keeps me on my toes.
      <br /><br />
      Join me on this journey through the world of code and soccer fandom. As I
      strive for excellence in my studies, I also kick around the soccer ball
      with enthusiasm and dedication. Let's connect, share ideas, and explore
      the endless possibilities that both the digital and sports worlds offer.
      <br /><br />
      Welcome to my corner of the internet, where technology meets the passion
      for play!
